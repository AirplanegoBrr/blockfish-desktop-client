### v1.0.0
Initial release
Features:
- Borderless window. There's a small part at the top of the window you can use to drag it around. 
- UI elements moved around to accommodate for the title bar overlay in the top right. 
- Detailed rich presence for discord. Can show what game mode you're playing and what you're doing (menu, store, inventory, forums, user profile)
- Better esc key binds. You can press esc to resume game after you've paused it instead of having to click the green button. 
- Adblock!! Everyone hates ads!!
- Fast startup time. Starts nearly instantly, compared to the 3 second start-up time for other clients. 
- Notification badges for forum notifications. When the client is open, it will show notification badges on the taskbar icon if you have any. Similar to badges on the discord taskbar icon. 
- Auto-pause. When you switch to another window, the game will automatically pause for you so that you don't wander off aimlessly and die. 
- Built-in evolution tree. Tired of forgetting how to evolve to a certain animal? Well now you can see the evolution tree right from the game!
- External links open in your browser instead of in a new app window, unlike other clients. 
- Exit confirmation. Just so that you don't get that "oh no I misclicked" moment and lose your 10M penguin run. 
- Smooth loading. The webpage completes loading before it shows you the window. Making the experience seem more polished and smooth.
